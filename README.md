# üîç Sorting & Pathfinding Visualizer

## Description
An interactive web application built with **Vite + React** to visualize common **sorting** and **pathfinding algorithms**.  
The app provides an educational and intuitive way to understand how these algorithms work step-by-step through animations.

---

## Why?
Understanding algorithms can be abstract and challenging when studied only in textbooks.  
This project was created to:
- Help students and developers **see algorithms in action**.  
- Provide a **hands-on learning tool** to experiment with different approaches.  
- Compare the **performance and behavior** of algorithms in real time.
